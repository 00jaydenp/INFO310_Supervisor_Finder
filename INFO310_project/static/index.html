               <h2>Mission</h2>
               <p>The mission of the Supervisor Finder Service is to match students with research projects curated by project supervisors 
                   <br> This service creates an opportunity for students to apply for postgraduate projects with ease
                   <br> while also allowing supervisors to learn more about their students.
               
              <h2>Functionality</h2>
              <p >
               Students will be able to view and apply for research projects that are created by supervisors in order
               to make the process of finding  <br> research projects a much easier process. 
               Project supervisors will be able to view these applications and view the applicants  <br> that 
               they believe are most suitable for their respective research project.
